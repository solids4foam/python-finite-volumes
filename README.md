# python-finite-volumes

This repository contains cell-centred finite volume codes for:

- Heat conduction
- Stokes (creeping) flow where the pressure gradient is known
- An incompressible solid block sagging under its own weight
- Laminar channel flow with an incompressible beam attached to the bottom wall of the channel experiencing fluid-structure interaction
